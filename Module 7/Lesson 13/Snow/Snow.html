        <div id="text">Snow is nature’s delicate artwork, transforming the world into a serene wonderland with its soft, white blanket. Each snowflake, unique in its intricate design, drifts gently from the sky, creating a peaceful silence that seems to slow time itself. The crisp, cold air carries a freshness that awakens the senses, while the ground glistens under the pale winter sun, reflecting countless tiny crystals. Snow has a magical way of changing familiar landscapes into something entirely new—trees wear shimmering coats, rooftops become frosted, and pathways turn into soft, muffled trails. It invites both quiet reflection and joyful play, from the calm beauty of a snowy morning to the laughter of children building snowmen or engaging in playful snowball fights. Beneath its beauty, snow also carries a sense of resilience, reminding us of nature’s cycles—how the stillness of winter prepares the earth for the renewal of spring. Whether admired from a warm window or experienced firsthand with cold cheeks and tingling fingers, snow holds a timeless charm that captures hearts across generations</div>
