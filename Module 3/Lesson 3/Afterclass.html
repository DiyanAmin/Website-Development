                <h4>Doing Nothing</h4> <br>
                In a world that constantly glorifies busyness, choosing to do nothing can be a surprisingly refreshing hobby.

Whether it’s sitting by a window watching the clouds drift, lying on the couch listening to the hum of life around you, or just closing your eyes in stillness, doing nothing can be a gentle act of self-care — a reminder that rest is just as valuable as productivity.
